        <h1>Hello!</h1>

        <p>I'm Alex Schepelmann, a Robotics and Computational Modeling Engineer at ZIN Technologies in Cleveland, Ohio.

		<p>My passion is robotics, especially robotic systems and actuators.  I hold a Ph.D. in Robotics from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University's</a> <a href="http://ri.cmu.edu">Robotics Institute</a>, as well as a M.S. and a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="http://case.edu">Case Western Reserve University</a>.  My expertise includes the design, control, and actuation of legged robotic systems, optimization-based design and control of robotic actuation technologies with a focus on series elastic actuators, state-estimation, numerical optimization, and real-time computer vision methods for obstance avoidance in autonomous vehicles.
		
		<p>At Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute, I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hgeyer/">Hartmut Geyer</a> investigating legged systems.  There, my research focused on the design and control of legged locomotion testbeds to evaluate decentralized swing-leg controllers, and the design and control of compact nonlinear springs for series elastic actuators. 
		
		<p>At Case Western Reserve University, I worked with <a href="http://engineering.case.edu/emae/Faculty/Roger_Quinn">Roger Quinn</a> in the <a href="http://biorobots.case.edu/">Center for Biologically Inspired Robotics Research</a>.  There, my research focused on creating real-time computer vision algorithms to enable autonomous vehicles to avoid obstacles.
		
		<p>I also provide consulting services for businesses looking to integrate and deploy robotics technologies.
